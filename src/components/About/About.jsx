        <p className="about-description">
          I am a recent <b>B.Tech</b> graduate in <b>Information Technology</b>{" "}
          from <b>United College of Engineering Research</b>. My academic
          experience has provided me with a solid foundation in programming and
          software development, with a particular emphasis on full-stack web
          development using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React,
          Node.js). Throughout my studies, I applied theoretical concepts to
          real-world applications, gaining hands-on experience through various
          projects. <br />
          <br /> One of my most significant projects was the development of a
          MedAssist App. By leveraging the MERN stack, I built a web application
          medical management platform designed to streamline healthcare
          processes, from patient records to appointment scheduling. It enhances
          efficiency and ensures seamless communication between healthcare
          providers and patients. This project sharpened my skills in creating
          scalable, user-friendly web solutions and deepened my understanding of
          full-stack development. Additionally, These experiences have
          strengthened my proficiency in both front-end and back-end
          technologies and enabled me to deliver efficient, user-focused
          solutions.
          <br />
          <br /> I am proficient in multiple programming languages, including{" "}
          <b>Java, C++, JavaScript, C, and SQL</b>, which complement my
          expertise in web technologies. Passionate about continuous learning, I
          stay updated with the latest trends and advancements in technology. In
          my free time, I enjoy exploring new programming concepts, reading
          about tech innovations, and watching Anime. As I begin my professional
          journey, I look forward to applying my skills and fresh perspective to
          exciting projects. Iâ€™m eager to join a dynamic team where I can make
          meaningful contributions and continue to grow as a developer.
